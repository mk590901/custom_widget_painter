# Stateless widget for visualization ECG wave

The project implements a widget for dynamic visualization of constantly incoming ECG data. Widget implements a specific visualization method, which consists in the fact that a newly received piece of data is superimposed on a previously drawn wave.

## Introduction

The number of components for graphical data visualization is relatively small. Especially on flutter. Most of them are in the nature of some standard set of widgets with a lot of options and settings. In essence, they are cloned components of charts built into products like Microsoft Excell or Google Sheets. It is more difficult to find widgets for displaying large amounts of data that are continuously received, for example, from measuring instruments. I decided to create my own widget for this, which is based on a very simple principle.
